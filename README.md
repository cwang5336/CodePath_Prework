# CodePath Prework
This is a prework app that I have to write for admition to
the Introduction to Mobile developnment course at CodePath.

**Function:
This app is extreamly simple and only have 5 functions. 
In the app, there is a total of 5 buttons that describes 
what happens when the button is pressed. To reset the app
the user will just have to tap anywhere on the background
of the app.
